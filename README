POD2TEXINFO

  NAME
  
   pod2texinfo -- Perl Online Documentation to TeXinfo
   
  SYNOPSIS
  
   pod2texinfo filters Perl pod documents to TeXinfo documents.
   
  Usage
  
   pod2texinfo perl_doc_entry.pod
   
   this will write to a file `perl_doc_entry.tex'.
   
  DESCRIPTION
  
   What pod2texinfo does:
   
     * Pod file `perl_doc_entry.pod' is filtered to `perl_doc_entry.tex'.
     * Indented paragraphs are translated into @example ... @end example.
     * other paragraphs are translated into strings with TeX special
       characters escaped.
       
    How headings are handled
    
   The headings are converted from their POD form into a TeXInfo
   equivalent, and the uncommon ones are indexed:
   
   =head1 heading command
          is translated into

        @subheading heading
        @cindex heading
   =head2 heading command
          is translated into

        @subsubheading heading
        @cindex heading
          only when heading does not match frequent patterns such as
          DESCRIPTION, DIAGNOSTICS,... otherwise it is translated into:

        @subsubheading heading
          
    How lists are handled
    
   =over N command
          is translated into

        @itemize
          if following =item starts with *,

        @enumerate
          if following =item starts with 1.,

        @table
          if else. Indentation level N is ignored.
   =back command
          is translated, as appropriate, into

        @end itemize
          if started with @itemize,

        @end enumerate
          if started with @enumerate,

        @end table
          if started with @table.
   =item * heading command
          is translated into

        @item
        heading
   =item 1. heading command
          is translated into

        @item
        heading
   =item heading command(other)
          is translated into

        @item
        heading
        @cindex heading
          
    How POD quotes are translated
    
   In heading text, and other paragraphs, the following translation of
   pod quotes are done, and then TeX special characters are escaped after
   that.
   
   I<text>
          @emph{text}
   B<text>
          @strong{text},
   S<text>
          text1, where text1 is a string with blank characters replaced
          with ~,
   C<text>
          @code{text2}, where text2 is a string with TeX special
          characters escaped to obtain a literal printout,
   E<text> (HTML escape)
          TeXInfo escaped string,
   L<text>
          This may include a URL or a referencing string as is done by
          pod2man,
   F<file>
          @file{file},
   Z<>
          a null string,

  Notes
  
    Bugs
    
   If HTML escapes E<text> other than E<amp>,E<lt>,E<gt>,E<quot> are used
   in C<>, translation will produce wrong character strings. Translation
   of HTML escapes of various European accents might be wrong.
